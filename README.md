Algorithmic Trading Bot in Rust

Log:
6/28/2022: Initial commit. Started playing with yahoo API. Played around with plotting, decided it's tough. Will focus on the actual bot part and implement plotting with python later

7/6/2022: Working implementation of basic scalable bot. Will try to make the basic strategy less jank and test during a trading day.
7/12/2022: Researched some analysis methods. Found technical analysis library for calculating EMA and such. Will test some trading strategies on BTC paper trading next time.
